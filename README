Data-Pareto version 0.01
========================

This simple module makes calculation of Pareto set. Given a set of vectors
(i.e. arrays of simple scalars), Pareto set is all the vectors from the given
set which are not dominated by any other vector of the set. 

Pareto sets play an important role in multiobjective optimization, where
each non-dominated (i.e. Pareto) vector describes objectives value of
"optimal" solution to the given problem.
